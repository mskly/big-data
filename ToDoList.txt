Update Map/Reduce/Driver to keep Tweet Text and Follower count.

Driver - Change output key/value classes of Map/Reduce

Map - Parse out the Tweet text. Change the value type to Text. Put the value as the Tweet Text.

Update: This is a MapOnly job for this filtering. I'll just use follower count as key, and Tweet Text as value.

Output to HBase instead of context.write() in the Reducer?
